HOW TO NAVIGATE IN P2S

There are two folders; "SPA-attempted" and "notSPA".

"notSPA" - This folder is the website with all its functionalities in tact. In order to properly use the services please use the contents of this folder.

"SPA-attempted" - This folder is our attempt on implementing SPA on to our website. We have the main pages working but need to include more angular directives in order to access some more functionalities.
